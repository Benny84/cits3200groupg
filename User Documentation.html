<H3 LANG="en-GB">What is the Club Process System?</H3>
<P LANG="en-GB">The Club Process System is a way of easily organising
and storing information about the running of events combined with a
system for sending out email reminders about those events.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB">Information about the organisation and running of
events is stored as &ldquo;tasks&rdquo;, which have a title, a body
and a status (either inactive, incomplete or complete). 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB">Tasks can then have email reminders set so that the
correct person is emailed about the task well in advance of it
needing to be completed. Email reminders are composed of a date the
email will be sent out on and the recipients email address. Emails
are only sent out when tasks are incomplete. 
</P>
<h3 LANG="en-GB"><span lang="en-au">Loging in</span></h3>
<P LANG="en-GB">To begin using the Club Process System, 
please login with the user details provided in the instillation.txt folder.

<H3 LANG="en-GB">Adding Tasks</H3>
<P LANG="en-GB">To add a completely new task select &ldquo;+Add Item
To Root&rdquo; from the content pane (located on the far left). Give
the task a title and a body of your choosing. These will be included
in any emails sent by this task. If you wish to attach an email
reminder to the task please check the &ldquo;Make Task?&rdquo; box.
This will set your tasks status to incomplete by default. Select
&ldquo;Confirm item&rdquo;.</P>

<H3 LANG="en-GB">Task Status</H3>
<P LANG="en-GB">If on the creation of a new task you do not select
the &ldquo;Make Task?&rdquo; box the task will default to being
inactive. This means that it will not send out any set email
notifications. This status can be changed by using the edit
functionality at any time. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB">If &ldquo;Make Task?&rdquo; is checked on creation
the task will default to an incomplete task, meaning that it <B>will</B>
send email notifications. When the task is completed simply select
the check-box next to it to make it a completed task, which will
disable email reminders.
