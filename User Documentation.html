<H3 LANG="en-GB">What is the Club Process System?</H3>
<P LANG="en-GB">The Club Process System is a way of easily organising
and storing information about the running of events combined with a
system for sending out email reminders about those events.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB">Information about the organisation and running of
events is stored as &ldquo;tasks&rdquo;, which have a title, a body
and a status (either inactive, incomplete or complete). 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB">Tasks can then have email reminders set so that the
correct person is emailed about the task well in advance of it
needing to be completed. Email reminders are composed of a date the
email will be sent out on and the recipients email address. Emails
are only sent out when tasks are incomplete. 
</P>
<H3 LANG="en-GB">Adding Tasks</H3>
<P LANG="en-GB">To add a completely new task select &ldquo;+Add Item
To Root&rdquo; from the content pane (located on the far left). Give
the task a title and a body of your choosing. These will be included
in any emails sent by this task. If you wish to attach an email
reminder to the task please check the &ldquo;Make Task?&rdquo; box.
This will set your tasks status to incomplete by default. Select
&ldquo;Confirm item&rdquo;.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB">Tasks can be appended to other tasks by clicking on
the task on the content pane and then selecting &ldquo;+Add Item&rdquo;
in the top right hand corner. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB">Only incomplete tasks (with the &ldquo;Make Task?&rdquo;
box checked on task creation) will send out email reminders.</P>
<H3 LANG="en-GB">Task Status</H3>
<P LANG="en-GB">If on the creation of a new task you do not select
the &ldquo;Make Task?&rdquo; box the task will default to being
inactive. This means that it will not send out any set email
notifications. This status can be changed by using the edit
functionality at any time. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB">If &ldquo;Make Task?&rdquo; is checked on creation
the task will default to an incomplete task, meaning that it <B>will</B>
send email notifications. When the task is completed simply select
the check-box next to it to make it a completed task, which will
disable email reminders. 
</P>
<H3 LANG="en-GB">Setting Email Reminders</H3>
<P LANG="en-GB">To set an email reminder on your task simple hover
over the tasks name and select the letter icon. Fill in the necessary
details and click &ldquo;Set email reminder&rdquo;. The task will be
sent as an email on the morning of the chosen date to the chosen
email address. 
</P>
<H3 LANG="en-GB">Removing Tasks and Email Reminders</H3>
<P LANG="en-GB">To remove a task or email reminder hover over it and
select the red cross. 
</P>
<H3 LANG="en-GB">Editing Tasks and Email Reminders</H3>
<P LANG="en-GB">To edit a task or email reminder hover over it and
select the pencil. 
</P>
<H3 LANG="en-GB">Navigating Around the Hierarchy</H3>
<P LANG="en-GB">Clicking on a task in the content pane will take you
to that tasks page and will display all children directly attached to
that task. It will not, however, display any tasks attached to those
attached tasks. You may click on the names of any attached tasks to
navigate to their pages.
