TODO List

%%%% should be done before monday? %%%%%

- be able to edit items which have task set and 'complete' them
- have set email reminder work with database + website
- actually have it send emails
- (DONE) * add the checkboxes to item titles
- (DONE) * get index page displaying just the root children
- (DONE) have heirachy working (more than 2 levels i suppose?, and only show the current item path) 
- (DONE) figure out how we want to set email reminders for children of the current item (use the same form?, 
position it diferently..)
- get index page email form working
- (DONE) "Add Task to Root" has "Enable Complete/Incomplete status?" while "Adding task to task" has "Make Task?" in same place. Make both into "Make Task?".


%%%% important to do but do other priority things first %%%%%

- on index page, put add item form at the bottom of content pane instead of link to the heirachy link
- allow deleting and editing of email reminders
- editing an item still resets it to the bottom of the heirachy
- have heirachy only show current item path + root items
- Hovering over an email address brings up "Edit" and "Delete" Icons at the far right of screen and they are unclickable.


%%%% we'll get here %%%%%

- have the editing done in-line (or replace the text with textfields) on the same page, instead of directing to 
another page
- when deleting the items children, refresh the page instead of going to index
- * center the confirm, clear, cancel links in all tabs
- * if clicking set email reminder and the form is already open, close it
- * OCD formatting
- make the current item path on the heirachy a filled circle, its children and other root items discs



* means me (eric) will get to it soon




Points of discussion

- limit the size of item titles? say to 100 characters (because it makes everything look ugly)
- allow time in email reminder setting? instead of just sending at midnight
- the gap between item titles and bodies look a bit weird (to have space for the mouse over links), should i
position the same as email reminders?
- mouse overs not working on phone browsers since theres no mouse (but you can click the empty space)
