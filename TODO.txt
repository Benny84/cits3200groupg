TODO List

%%%% should be done before monday? %%%%%

- (DONE) be able to edit items which have task set and 'complete' them
- (DONE) have set email reminder work with database + website
- actually have it send emails
- (DONE) * add the checkboxes to item titles
- (DONE) * get index page displaying just the root children
- (DONE) have heirachy working (more than 2 levels i suppose?, and only show the current item path) 
- (DONE) figure out how we want to set email reminders for children of the current item (use the same form?, 
position it diferently..)
- (DONE) get index page email form working
- (DONE) "Add Task to Root" has "Enable Complete/Incomplete status?" while "Adding task to task" has "Make Task?" in same place. Make both into "Make Task?".
- (DONE) Add emails to the database


%%%% important to do but do other priority things first %%%%%

- (DONE) on index page, put add item form at the bottom of content pane instead of link to the heirachy link
- (DONE) allow deleting of email triggers
- editing an item still resets it to the bottom of the heirachy
- have heirachy only show current item path + root items

%%%% we'll get here %%%%%

- allow editing of email triggers
- have the editing done in-line (or replace the text with textfields) on the same page, instead of directing to 
another page
- when deleting the items children, refresh the page instead of going to index
- make the current item path on the heirachy a filled circle, its children and other root items discs
- when hovering over the buttons, the underline dissapears
- (DONE) remove old email reminder notes on the page (ie the ones already sent)
- only send the email reminder IF the task is still incomplete (if set by user)

%%%%% bugs? %%%%%
